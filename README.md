# spellbook-loot
A random generator for spellbooks as loot for Dungeons and Dragons 5e

Usage.

When ran, using python 3.* it will constantly ask for a wizard level to generate a spellbook for. It will then perform the maths needed 
to determine the maximum level spells a wizard of level x would have, and decide on a number of spells of each level the wizard would 
have based on level. ( I eyeballed this and the maths is in the code as magicmath if you are interested)

It will then print a list of spells based on the wizard level they know. Currently alllows some duplication under "Personalized xxx" 
where xxx is the duplicate spell.

Feedback, comments and critique welcome.
